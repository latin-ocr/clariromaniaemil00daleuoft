88 AEMILIUS PAULUS

as Proconsul to Further Spain, where the warlike
Lusitanians were defying the Roman power. After
sustaining a severe defeat, he gained a great victory, which
for a time brought tranquillity to that part of the Roman
dominions. He was Consul for the first time in the year
18⁶2, after vainly secking election more than once. In the
following year he held a command against a Ligurian tribe
who were giving trouble as pirates. His success was coni-
plete, and the power of the pirates was destroyed.
Aemilius received a triumph.

After his return from the conquest of Macedonia, he
was elected to the Censorship in the year 164. The wise
moderation he showed as Censor added to his influence,
already very strong, in the Senate. He died in 160.

The narrative of the third Macedonian war shows us
clearly enough the energy and efficiency of Paulussshis
firmness in face of adverse opinion, his resolution in mis-
fortune, his courage and swiftness of decision in a moment
of danger, his moderation in victory, and his generosity to
the conquered. lt does not show us what was no less
celebrated in antiquity-—his blameless private life, and the
simplicity and frugality with which he continued to live
after his victory had brought to Rome one of the richest
prizes ever secui-ed by her arms.

A man of Paulus's unflinching uprightness could not be
friends with everybody. He had, moreover, a hereditary
dislike for demagogues, for any who attempted to take
from the nobles in the Senate the offices and powers which
custom and the exigencies of warfare had given them. He
refused to petition humbly for votes when secking election
to a magistracy. In dealing with his soldiers he cared
nothing for their power as voters in the Roman Assembly.
Had their animosity deprived him of his triumph, we may
well believe that he would have borne the loss of that dis-
tinction with the same high courage as he faced the loss
