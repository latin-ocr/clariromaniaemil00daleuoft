These Maps ase now recognized as the best and most convenient in
existence for the use of scholars and students at the Universities and
upper classes of schools.

The old method of engraving and hatching the mountain ranges has
been exchanged for that of colouring the contours with flat brown and
. green tints, which is acknowledged to be the best and most intelligible
way of denoting the configuration of the land. A SEPARATE INDEX
Is 1NCLUDED wrrfl EACH ΜΑΡ.

The Maps in this series nre distinot from those in Murray’s
Classical Atlas, and are eonsiderably larger.

Athenaeum—“These maps of Mr. Murray's are sas better than
anything which has yet been attempted in the direction of teaching
the physical features of ancient geography, and they deserve all
attention from studems and schoolmasters.”
