APPENDIX C 91

There were also [⁴200 velites or light-armed in each
legion.

The Macedonian army, reinsorced as it was by numerous
allied contingents, Thracians and others, consisted for the
most part of the phalanx. Philip, the father of Alexander,
and Alexander himself, had found a serried mass of infantry
army with long thrusting spears a serviceable means of
breaking an opposing line armed with the shorter weapons
of the ordinary Greek or barbarian army. Under the later
Macedonian Kings the length of the spear‚ which was
eighteen feet, was considerably increased. The ranks
stood so close together that the spears of the fifth rank
projected well in frunt of the first. Thus the soldier could
not turn his spear to either side without its becoming
entangled with the rnen before or behind him (of course, so
heavy a spear could not be held without a long butt pro-
jeeting behind the spearman).

All went well with the phalanx as long as the ground
was level and there were no gaps in the line. Its hedge of
spears could bear down the Roman manipular or any other
formation. But on rough ground the manipular arrange-
ment was far better. lt gave great freedom of rnovement,
and the individua! Roman soldier was trained to fight in
close or more open order as the ground required. As soon
as a gap appeared in the phalanx, the Roman had the
Macedonian at his mercy. Hurling his javelin as he
charged, the Roman was free to use his formidable short
sword at close quarters upon an enemy encumbered by his
unwieldy spear. Under such circumstances the combat
would soon become a mere slaughter. At Pydna the
hurried formation of the line left gaps in the phalanx.
The various divisions of the phalanx, sometimes referred to
as separate phalanxes (white-shields, bronze-shields, etc.)‚
were isolated, and no doubt the battle was not fought on
such level ground as the King would have wished. Had
