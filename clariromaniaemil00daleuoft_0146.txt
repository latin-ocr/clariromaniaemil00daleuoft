APPENDIX A

ROME AND MACEDONIA

Pfflmp V.‚ King of Macedonia, was twice at war with Rome.
The first war lasted from 215 13.st to 205 ac. Philip, who
was jealous of the increasing influence of Rome on the
east side of the Adriatic, seized the opportunity offered by
the desperate struggle of the Romans with Hannibal, and
concluded an alliance with Carthage. The war was with-
out definite results. Philip's attention was occupied in
maintaining his supremacy in Greece, and the Roman
arms were so much employed in Italy, Spain, and Africa
that they were unable to concentrate their strength upon
the overthrow of the Macedonian power.

The second war (eoo-196 uc.) was more serious. As
soon as the struggle with Carthage was over, the Romans
listened to the complaints which came from Philip’s
neighbours, and declared war. The Consul Sulpicius did
not distinguish himself as a commander, and the result of
the first campaign was certainly not in favour of Rome,
His successor had no better fortune. Flamininus, the
third Roman General, had his command prolonged until,
in 197, he won a ‘¹ soldiers' battle '¹ at Cynoscephalae in
Thessaly. Philip lost 1:3‚000 men, and had no alternative
but to submit. He became the ally of Rome, sui-rendering
his fleet, his foreign possessions, and the right to an

inde-pendent foreign policy. This alliance was so burden>
