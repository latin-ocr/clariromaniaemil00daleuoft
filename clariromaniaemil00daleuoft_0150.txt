90 AEMILIUS PAULUS

Olympus mass, a trade route ran through Pythium over the
Macedonian frontier to Petra, and thence down to Dium
and the coast road. Carefully concealing his intentions
from the enemy, Aemilius sent through the mountains a
picked force to surprise the garrisons which Perseus, who
was by no means an incompetent commander, had
prudently stationed at Pythium and Petra. Thus
threatened in his rear, Perseus had to fall back on Pydna.
There was more space there, however, between the
mountains and the sea. Perseus must either give battle
or allow the Romans to enter Macedonia as they pleased.
He could not get behind fortifications and yet check the
Roman advance as at the line of the Enipeus, He therefore
gave battle.

The Consular army regularly consisted of two legions of
Roman citizens, each accompanied by an equal number oi
Italian allies (Latius, Mai-meinimis, Paelignians‚ etc.),
divided into “coh01-ts.’‘ The legion number-ed 4-‚200
infanti-ymen, with a contingent of 300 cavalry. With other
contingents of allies from Greece and elsewhere, the army
of Paulus probably numbered well over 20‚000 men. The
army of Perseus was probably rather larger.

The legion was regularly drawn up in three lines-hastati,
principes, and triarii. Each line was divided into ten
manipleS. The manipleffi the tactical unit, consisted of 120
men in each of the first two lines. In a maniple of triarii
there were 60 men. The maniples of the three lines were
drawn up in such a way that the intervals between the
maniples in the first line were filled by the maniples in the
second:

The maniplo. was divi-hul into two “ centuries‚'' οι· omnpanics, each
under a *⁶ non-0011nuiss-ioum] '¹ centurion.
