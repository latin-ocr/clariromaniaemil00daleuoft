Latin teaching which the Classical Association has been advocating

teaching and had also from the beginning actively supported the new
movement. Their book. Limen. was published in October, 1908.

the lines of the book.

carefully graduated in style and vocabulary so that they can be
assimilated pari passu with the Accidence and Composition.

deal that is fresh and valuable.''
