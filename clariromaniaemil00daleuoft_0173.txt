“Clari Romani ’' Series. Edited by w. L. paine. Μ.Α.,
Whitgist Gramma-r School, Croydon.

The object of this series Is to supply beginners with Latin narrative
which can be easily read. Care has therefore been taken to select
interesting stories, and to simplify the text where it has seemed too
difficult.

A lull vocabulary and historical appendix are included in each volume,
but there are no notes. It has been thought best to let the master
decide the amount os help in translation which the class ought to receive.

For those who mtend further to pursue the study of theganguage.
the series endeavours to satisfy the claims of good scho arship by
providing a set of exercises designed to test their knowledge of
accidence, syntax, and composition. This portion of the book is
interleaved. as the authors are of opinion that it is a good thing t'or

the beginner to make his own record of progress, and to keep it under
the same cover as the book he has read.
