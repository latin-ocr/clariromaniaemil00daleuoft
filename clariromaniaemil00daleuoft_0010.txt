vi PREFACE

exercises designed to test their knowledge of accidence,
syntax, and composition. This portion of the book
is interleaved‚ as the authors are of opinion that it
is a good thing for the beginner to make his own
record of progmss, and to keep it under the same
cover as the book he has read.

Teachers are recommended to read the preliminary
note as to the method of using the exercises.

N.B.—As this text is meant for use by quite young
beginners, it has been thought advisable to print v
instead of the consonante] u throughout.
