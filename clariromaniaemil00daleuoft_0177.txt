The genesis oi Ante Limen is as follows z—After the publication ot*
Limen, which was written for pupils beginning Latin at the age of
eleven. a large number of letters were received from teachers who
approved oi its method asking for a book on similar lines for younger
beginners.

The authors of Limen, thinking that this work could best be done
by one who is in daily contact with young pupils. commissioned
Miss R. H. Rees, who had previously prepared the Appendix of
dialogues for Limen. to put together the necessary material under their
direction. When the first draft of the book was in type they sent it to
several preparatory schoolmasters and mistresses ἴοι· criticism. and
received from them many valuable hints in connexion with its scope
and arrangement. Almost every alteration or addition that has
been made owes its origin to a suggestion from a practical teacher. so
it is confidently hoped that in its present shape Α nte Limen will provide
a thoroughly sound and workmanlike course of study ior those who
begin Latin early.

The lines of the parent book have been closely followed, though the
arrangement is different z the Reading lessons. Exercises and Vocabu-
laries have been arranged in three parallel divisions. The oral method
is employed from the start, and the simple nature of the earliest
questions ought to disarm any teacher who is diffident about his
powers of using it. The authors would like to take t'nis opportunity
of asking those who have not yet tried oral teaching—i.e.. oral teaching
of the kind set forth here. and not doggerel Latin about modern
matters—to give it a trial, as the uniform chorus of approval from
those who have made the experiment seems to testify to its efficacy.

The ground covered by Ante Limen is. roughly speaking. up to the
end οἱ the regular declensions. and the active verb without the
subjunctive. When he has reached this point the pupil ought to have
acquired a certain amount oi readiness in composition and facility in
translating. as well as a working knowledge oi the simpler syntactical
ffinsltructions. and ought to be in a position to make rapid progress in

e anguage.
