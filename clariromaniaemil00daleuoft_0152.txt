92 AEMILIUS PAULUS

the Romans fought on the day before, attacking the mass
of the phalanx (20,000 strong) drawn up on level ground,
with its flanks properly protected, the result of the battle
might have been far different. Aemilius knew what he
was about. A Saying of his is reported, that a good General
never gives battle except in the last necessity or upon a
very favourable opportunity. Perhaps at Pydna both of
these conditions were fulfilled.

APPENDIX D

ROMAN NAMES

A RoMAN regularly had three names. The name proper,
or nomen, was the name of his clan (gens)-—C0rnelius,
Aemilius, Sulpicius, He had also acognonien, or surname‚
showing to what family in the clau he belonged——Galbffi
Paulus, Gallus, etc. Then he had a praenomen, or
persona] name—Lucius, Marcus, Gaius, etc.

Some Romans had no surnaine. Others had more than
one. The names were written in this order: praenomen,
nomen, cognomen. Thus we find L. Aemilius Paulus,
Cn. Octavius (no surnuine), Ρ. Cornelius Scipio Nasica (two
surnames).

Several examples of Roman names and surnames will be
found in Chapter ΙΙ.

If adopted into another family, a Roman took the name
and surname of the family into which he was adopted,
retaining his old name under a new form as a surname.
Thus the son of Paulus whom Scipio adopted was called
P. Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus.
